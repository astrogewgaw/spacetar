## Space molecules in your terminal!

[**spacetar**][spacetar] is a command line interface that allows you to search the database of *known* space molecules across all sorts of parameters. The data is scraped from the well-maintained space molecule bibliography over at [**www.astrochymist.org**][astrochymist], created by David Woon. [**spacetar**][spacetar] scraps the HTML source code, gets all the data, and then stores it as an SQLite database. It then uses the brilliant ORM interface provided by [**SQLAlchemy**][SQLAlchemy] to search this database across all the parameters provided by you, the user. I also use the amazing [**rich**][rich] library to display the search results on the terminal. This project is still in its infancy, so I am sure it has its fair share of bugs :bug:. If you find one, open an [**issue**][issues]. If you have an idea, or a feature you would like to request, you can either open an [**issue**][issues], or start a [**discussion**][discussions]. Do let me know if you end up having some fun with this :grin: !
