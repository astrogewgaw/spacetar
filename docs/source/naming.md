# What's in a name?

<div align="justify">

When I was thinking about a name for the package, I suddenly remembered a line from **Carl Sagan** and **Bishun N. Khare**'s paper on *tholins*, organic compounds formed by irradiating simple compounds, such as carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane, and so on, with electromagnetic radiation or cosmic rays. They said, and I quote (all *weird formatting* mine):

For the past decade we have been producing in our laboratory a variety of complex organic solids from mixtures of the cosmically abundant gases CH<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, HCHO, and H<sub>2</sub>S. The product, synthesized by ultraviolet (UV) light or spark discharge, is a brown, sometimes sticky, residue, which has been called, because of its resistance to conventional analytical chemistry, "*intractable polymer*". [...] We propose, as a model-free descriptive term, ‘tholins’ (Gk. *ϴὸλος*, *muddy*; but also *ϴoλòς*, *vault* or *dome*), although we were tempted by the phrase:

The last part must have really struck me, considering how I remembered it so well even after reading it several years earlier! Since this package is all about molecules in *space*, I decided to call it *spacetar* instead of *star-tar*. As we get better at detecting molecules fro interstellar spectra, we have started to discover molecules of increasing complexity, making the name more and more appropriate 😁 !
