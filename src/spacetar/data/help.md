# Quick Start

To explore the world of space molecules :test_tube: :alembic: in your
terminal :computer:, just type:

```bash
spacetar molecules
```

This displays the full table of molecules detected in space. Similarly,
spacetar can display the associated tables for the astronomical sources
:milky_way: :star: where these molecules have been detected, and the
telescopes :telescope: :satellite: used to detect them, by typing:

```bash
spacetar sources
```

and

```bash
spacetar telescopes
```

respectively. To search any of these tables, spacetar comes with a large
number of options that you can pass to the respective sub-commands. You
can get a detailed usage guide :memo: for all of these sub-commands by
typing:

```bash
spacetar usage
```

By default, this displays a usage guide for the command line interface (
a.k.a. the CLI). You can also get a equally-detailed guide for using the
power of spacetar in your Python programs, by typing:

```bash
spacetar usage python
```

Both usage guides are displayed in a pager by default. To get this help
message, you can type:

```bash
spacetar help
```

or 

```bash
spacetar --help
```

Similarly, to get the version of spacetar installed on your system, you
can type:

```bash
spacetar version
```

or

```bash
spacetar --version
```
